"""GEPA prompt optimization script.

Optimizes a system prompt (or any text artifact) using GEPA's evolutionary
Pareto search with LLM reflection. The agent modifies this file to change:
  - TASK_LM: the model being optimized
  - REFLECTION_LM: the model doing reflection (should be stronger)
  - SEED: the initial prompt to optimize
  - METRIC: the evaluation function
  - TRAINSET / VALSET: the evaluation data
  - MAX_METRIC_CALLS: budget (number of evaluations)

Usage:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=...  # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    python optimize.py > run.log 2>&1

Grep-parsable output:
    val_score: 0.85
    best_prompt: <the optimized prompt>
