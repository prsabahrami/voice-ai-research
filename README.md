# PraxLab

Autonomous experiment harness inspired by [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch). Point an AI agent at a task, and it builds, trains, and iterates forever — modifying model architectures, reward functions, prompts, and hyperparameters to continuously improve. Supports pre-training, post-training, and prompt optimization.

Each directory is a self-contained workspace with its own `program.md` (agent instructions), mutable training scripts, and experiment tracking. The agent reads `program.md`, builds the setup, then loops: hypothesize → modify → run → evaluate → keep or discard → repeat. It never stops.

## Quick Start

| I want to... | Go here |
|--------------|---------|
| **Pre-train from scratch (architecture research)** | `pretrain/` |
| **RL (GRPO) with Tinker SDK** | `tinker/rl/` |
| **SFT with Tinker SDK** | `tinker/sl/` |
| **RL with Prime Intellect** | `prime/` |
| **Prompt optimization with GEPA** | `gepa/` |

### Step-by-step

1. **Pick a directory** based on your training method and backend
2. **Edit `program.md`** — fill in Section 1 with your task description, model, and cost budget
3. **Set credentials** — `export TINKER_API_KEY=...`, `prime login`, or `modal setup`
4. **Spin up your favourite coding agent** with the prompt: `"Read program.md and begin the loop!"`

The agent will:
- Create a git worktree for the experiment (main stays clean as the starter template)
- Build the training setup from your task description
- Form hypotheses with causal mechanisms before each experiment
- Run experiments, confirm/refute mechanisms after each result
- Track structured research memory via `lab` CLI (queryable across sessions)
- Keep improvements, discard failures (via git commits)
- Never stop until you tell it to (or it hits your cost budget)

To reset after an experiment: `git checkout main` (or run `./clean.sh` to also remove generated files).

## The `lab` CLI

Structured experiment memory shared across all directories. 5 commands, zero dependencies (stdlib only).

```bash
./lab hypothesis "increase LR" -m "faster convergence in early training"   # before
./lab experiment h1                                                         # before
./lab result e1 -v keep --metrics '{"val_bpb": 0.993}' --mechanism-confirmed  # after
./lab context                                                               # session start
./lab failures                                                              # don't repeat
```

The agent runs `lab context` + `lab failures` at session start to reconstruct state, then logs each experiment with a hypothesis (what + why) and result (keep/discard + mechanism confirmed/refuted). Data lives in `data/experiments.db`, isolated per directory.

## Tips for Writing a Good program.md

The quality of your `program.md` Section 1 directly determines the quality of results.

### Be specific about the task
Bad: "Make the model better at math"
Good: "Train Qwen3-8B to solve GSM8K-style word problems. The model should show its work step-by-step and put the final numeric answer in \\boxed{}. Correct means the number inside \\boxed{} matches the ground truth."

### Specify your model
For **post-training** (tinker, prime):
- **Small + fast iteration**: `Qwen/Qwen3-8B`, `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B`
- **Efficient MoE**: `Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B` (30B params, only 3B active)
- **Maximum capability**: `Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B`, `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324`

For **pre-training** (`pretrain/`), the model is defined in `train.py` and trained from scratch.

### Choose the right approach

| Task type | Best approach | Directory |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Architecture research (attention, FFN, scaling) | Pre-train | `pretrain/` |
| Optimizer research (Muon, SOAP, schedules) | Pre-train | `pretrain/` |
| Verifiable answers (math, code, classification) | GRPO (RL) | `tinker/rl/` |
| Subjective quality (writing, conversation) | SFT | `tinker/sl/` |
| Multi-turn / agentic (tool use, games, dialogue) | Prime RL | `prime/` |
| Complex environments (sandboxed code, browser) | Prime RL | `prime/` |
| Prompt/rubric optimization | GEPA | `gepa/` |
| Agent architecture search | GEPA | `gepa/` |

## How It Works

This project follows the [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) pattern:

1. **Human writes `program.md`** — strategic decisions (what task, what model, what approach)
2. **Agent executes the loop** — tactical decisions (what hyperparams, what reward tweaks, what data to add)
3. **Git tracks everything** — every experiment is a commit. Improvements are kept. Failures are reverted.
4. **`results.tsv` is the scoreboard** — one number to optimize (val_bpb, eval_reward_mean, or eval_loss)
5. **`lab` CLI is the research memory** — structured hypotheses, mechanism tracking, failure avoidance. Queryable across sessions.

The key insight from [the blog post](https://hamzamostafa.com/blog/agents-training-their-own-models): agents are good at *execution* within constraints but poor at *judgment*. So we make the human decisions strategic and the agent decisions tactical. The constraints (`program.md` + best practices) are what make it work.
