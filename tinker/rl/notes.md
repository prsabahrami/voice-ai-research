# Experiment Notes — Pure RL Math Reasoning (DeepSeek-R1-Zero Reproduction)

---

## HEADLINE RESULT
**90.5% on MATH level 4-5** (competition math) with ZERO scaffolding — no system prompt, no few-shot, no CoT instructions. Reasoning (`<think>` blocks, self-correction, `\boxed{}` format) emerged purely from binary reward signal. 2% unsolved rate on eval set.

## WHAT WORKED (ranked by impact)

1. **MAX_TOKENS is THE lever** — 512→1024 (+4.8%), 1024→2048 (+5.0%), 2048→4096 (+2.4%). Diminishing returns but still the biggest single-knob impact.
2. **Pure RL emergent reasoning** — `<think>` blocks, self-correction, `\boxed{}` ALL emerged from binary reward. No scaffolding needed.
3. **Curriculum escalation** — GSM8K → MATH 1-3 → MATH 2-5. Each step improved eval.
4. **PPO > all other losses** — PPO is fast, stable, best quality. IS slower. CISPO same quality but 3x slower. DRO catastrophic.
5. **Early stopping (50 batches)** — Matches 100 at HALF compute. Late training overfits on 180 prompts.
6. **GROUP_SIZE scales with MAX_TOKENS** — 32 best at 1024, 16 fine at 2048, 8 sufficient at 4096. Smaller groups OK when model is strong.

## WHAT DID NOT WORK

1. **DRO loss** — CATASTROPHIC (6.1% eval). Never use for math RL.
2. **N_BATCHES 200** — Overfits on limited data.
3. **LoRA rank 64** — More params hurt optimization without more data.
4. **LR changes** — 2e-5 too slow, 6e-5 too fast. 4e-5 is optimal.
5. **Mixed easy+hard data** — Easy data dilutes hard signal.
6. **MoE models** — 3B active << 8B dense for math.
7. **Qwen3.5 models** — Not available on Tinker (400 errors).

## CURRENT BEST CONFIG
Model: Qwen/Qwen3-8B, PPO, LR=4e-5, **MAX_TOKENS=4096**, GROUP_SIZE=8, BATCH_SIZE=128, N_BATCHES=50, LoRA rank=32. Pure binary reward, zero scaffolding.

## LOSS FUNCTION RANKING
1. **PPO** — fast, stable, best
2. **CISPO** — same quality, 3x slower
3. **importance_sampling** — works but slower convergence
4. **DRO** — CATASTROPHIC, never use

## MAX_TOKENS SCALING LAW
| MAX_TOKENS | eval_reward_mean | Delta |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| 512 | ~0.77 | — |
| 1024 | 0.815 | +4.8% |
| 2048 | 0.881 | +5.0% |
| 4096 | 0.905 | +2.4% |

Diminishing returns but still the highest-impact lever. Next test: 8192?
